Please design a ticket tracking system. This system allows QA to report a bug and RD can mark a bug as resolved.
A. Phase I Requirement:
- There are two types of user: QA and RD.
- Only QA can create a bug, edit a bug and delete a bug.
- Only RD can resolve a bug.
- Summary field and Description filed are required of a bug when QA is creating a bug.
B. Phase II Requirement:
- Adding new field Severity and Priority to a ticket.
- Adding new type of user “PM” that can create new ticket type “Feature Request”. And only RD can mark it as resolved.
- Adding new ticket type “Test Case” that only QA can create and resolve. It’s read-only for other type of users.
- Adding new type of user “Administrator” user that can manage all the stuffs including adding new QA, RD and PM user.
